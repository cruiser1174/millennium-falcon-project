# millennium-falcon-project
 
This project has been built using a python-Flask backend connected to a React frontend. It is hosted on a localhost and can be started in a few steps:

1. Open a terminal and activate the backend virtual environment by running the activate script - from the root directory run _flask_backend\backend_venv\Scripts\activate_
2. navigate to the _react_frontend_ directory.
3. Start the backend by running _npm run start-backend_
4. Open a new terminal and repeat steps 1 and 2
5. Start the frontend by running _npm start_

These should open the application in your web browser at localhost/3000
